Below is the plan for repainting my bedroom.
The first step involves clearing the room of any furniture, both freestanding and wall mounted. Take extra care when moving the desk as the wood is easy to scratch and the metal easy to dent.
Once the room is empty, proceed with wall painting preparations. Secure the ceiling circumference with tape. Cover the floor with a plastic sheet and fix it on top of the wooden baseboards using tape. This way chances of accidental paint splatter are minimized, preventing damage to the ceiling or the floor tiling.
Now the walls can be painted using a roller brush. Pay attention not to soak the roller with too much paint, this will lead to dripping or paint running down the walls. Cover the walls in paint evenly to ensure a consistent color and texture. Let the paint dry for a period of three to six hours, repeat above steps if the old color can be seen seeping through.
Remove the previously applied floor cover and tape. Return the furniture back into the bedroom, making sure to not cause damage to the freshly painted walls. It is recommended to ventilate the room for at least one full day before utilization.
